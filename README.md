# mechanical-7-segment-clock
A large mechanical 7-segment clock using cheap stepper motors.

##
Each digit requires its own controller board. The seconds digit acts as the master keeping time using the DS3231 RTC and sending I2C commands out to the other digits. The rest of the digits act as slaves receiving numbers via I2C and displaying the number. The minute tens digit needs I2C address #3 hours digit dress #2 and hours tens dress #1.
